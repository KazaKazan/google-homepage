A recreation of the Google homepage for The Odin Project

This is definitely not perfect, here are some issues I'm aware of:

* The placements are a bit off, I didn't want to "cheat" so I didn't really use dev tools to check the actual placements. The differences are small enough that if I wasn't switching between the legit site and my recreation I wouldn't notice.
* Certain colors are a bit off, I just eyeballed them. Again, a really tiny difference that I wouldn't even notice if I wasn't switching between sites.
* The font isn't correct, **Roboto** is the closest I could find. The font Google uses is a tiny bit wider but otherwise very similar.
* This page is based on the version of Google that I see when I go to the site. So no microphone icon etc.
* Couldn't find the exact icons Google uses, used the ones provided in the assignment instead. I also didn't recolor them so they're black instead of dark grey.
* The site isn't "responsive" in the same ways that the actual homepage is. The footer doesn't change placement/justification etc. depending on the window size.
  
In my opinion, the differences are small enough that an unsuspecting person would really think this is the Google homepage, which is good enough for me for my first assignment.

I might revisit this later to add more functuonality but for now I think it's done.
